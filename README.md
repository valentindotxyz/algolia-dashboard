# Algolia Dashboard x Valentin

This project relies on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the Front-End generation and on [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/fr/) for the API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

Install dependencies for both the Back-end API as well as the Front-end.

### `yarn start`

Runs the Front-end app in development mode on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:3000).<br />
The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
